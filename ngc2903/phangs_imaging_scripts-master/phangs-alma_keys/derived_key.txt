# DERIVED PRODUCT DEFINITION KEY
##########################################################################

# This key defines the derived science-ready data products produced by
# the by the pipeline. The general format is

# configuration spectral_product field values

# Column 1: configuration name (e.g., 12m+7m, 7m+tp, etc.). This needs
# to refer to a configuration defined in the config_definition.

# "all" is an acceptable wildcard.

# Column 2: spectral product name.  This needs to refer to a
# configuration defined in the config_definition.

# "all" is an acceptable wildcard.

# Column 3: derived product field being defined. These come from a
# list of possible fields, see below.

# Column 4: values input for that field. This is read as a literal
# dictionary, avoid spaces. Multiple lines for a single field + config
# + spectral product combination are fine. In general, later lines
# overwrite previous ones.

# FIELDS

# phys_res - target physical resolutions in parsecs. Format is a a set
# of 'tag':value pairs in which the value is the parsec target and the
# tag is the tag to insert into filenames. Galaxies need defined
# distances in order to be convolved to fixed physical resolutions.

# ang_res - target angular resolutions in arcseconds. Format is a a
# set of 'tag':value pairs in which the value is the arcsecond target
# and the tag is the tag to insert into filenames.

# convolve_kw - keywords for convolution.

# noise_kw - keywords for noise estimation.

# strictmask_kw - keywords for generation of stict masks.

# broadmask_kw - keywords for generation of broad masks.

# mask_configs - the names of other configurations to link when
# creating broad masks. All masks for all linked configurations will
# be combined to create the broad masks.

# moments - the list of moments (defined in the moment key) to
# calculate for that that config and spectral product pair.
